# RAG Using Whisper Model üéôÔ∏èüìö
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation  system using OpenAI's Whisper model for speech recognition, combined with document processing capabilities. The system can transcribe speech and answer questions using information retrieved from PDF documents about machine learning.
# Features üåü

Real-time speech recognition using Whisper model \
PDF document processing and information extraction \
Question-answering system using RAG architecture \
Integration with machine learning knowledge base \
Interactive user interface for queries 
# OpenAI Realtime RAG Assistant

This is a fork of [openai-realtime-console](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console) adapted to demonstrate voice based RAG assistants using their [realtime api](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta). All credit to the OpenAI team for putting together the majority of this. Please refer to their original repo for more detailed information on how the backend works.

# Loading the Vector Database

The [VDB_Setup.ipynb](VDB_Setup.ipynb) notebook is included with step-by-step instructions for setting up your vector database and hosting the query function as a REST API. Follow along to set up your own ChromaDB vector database.

# Starting the console

This is a React project created using `create-react-app` that is bundled via Webpack.
Install it by extracting the contents of this package and using;

```shell
$ npm i
```

Start your server with:

```shell
$ npm start
```

It should be available via `localhost:3000`.

# Changing the System Prompt

The [conversation_config.js](src/utils/conversation_config.js) holds the main system prompt for the agent. For example it is set up to do Q&A over an assumed marketing related knowledgebase. Edit this file to personalize your system prompt.

```
System settings:
Tool use: enabled.

Instructions:
- You are an artificial intelligence agent responsible for assisting a user in discussing and educating themselves on marketing 
- You have access to a database filled with Marketing Expertise as your tool, always retrieve relevant information from the database to get the right context to assist the user's ask.
- Please make sure to respond with a helpful voice via audio
- Be kind, helpful, and curteous, and conversational
- It is okay to ask the user questions and followups
- The user will always start the conversation by saying Hello
- Generate your responses as if they are conversational and informal- stray away from super long complex structured responses but maintain the core crucial information

Personality:
- Be upbeat and genuine, like a true marketer!
- Speak quickly as if excited
```

# Using the console

The console requires an OpenAI API key (**user key** or **project key**) that has access to the
Realtime API. You'll be prompted on startup to enter it. It will be saved via `localStorage` and can be
changed at any time from the UI.

To start a session you'll need to **connect**. This will require microphone access.
You can then choose between **manual** (Push-to-talk) and **vad** (Voice Activity Detection)
conversation modes, and switch between them at any time.
